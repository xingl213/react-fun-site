# fUN SITE
I built this React single page application to make me laugh!

You are welcomed to visit it [here](https://xingl213.github.io/create-react-app/). (Updated Jan 8, 2022: Although I've finished implementing all major components, gh-pages deployment takes quite a bit of time so the complete version of the application may not be visible through this link yet)

# Components
Making use of React Router Dom, this application allows you to easily navigate through the three interesting components it offers while minimizing the rendering time of each view.
- Pun of the day (part of header -- that's why it appears in every view), where you can try to solve a brain teaser;
- Home component, where you can find featured movies and games rendered in slide show;
- About component records the rationale behind building this application;
- Trivia component is made of fun trivia games about myself. Each game is of a different topic!
